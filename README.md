 Student Grade Manager
 
Author: Delina Merhay

Project Objective

My project proposal is to implement a Student Grade Manager, where each student is represented by a name, randomly generated ID, and grades. The system will store multiple students in an array and provide functions for user input of student details and grades (for multiple subjects or assignments). It will calculate and display individual average grades for each student and optionally calculate the overall average grade for all students in each subject. It will demonstrate key C++ concepts like arrays, functions, control structures, and input/output operations, etc.

Key Features

Input and storage of student details (name, ID, grades)

Random generation of 4-digit student IDs

Support for multiple subjects (currently set to 3, easily adjustable)

Calculation of individual student grade averages

Calculation of overall subject averages across all students

Input validation for grades (0-100 range)

Capacity to manage up to 100 students


Technology used


C++


How to Use


1. Compile the C++ program using a c++ compiler(visual studio).
  
2. Run the compiled executable.
  
3. Enter the number of students you want to manage.
   
4. For each student, enter their name and grades for each subject.

5. The program will display the individual student averages and overall subject averages.
   

   Usage Example
   

How many students do you want to enter? 2

Entering details for student 1:

Enter student name: Alice

Enter grades for 3 subjects (0 - 100):

Subject 1: 85

Subject 2: 90

Subject 3: 88

Entering details for student 2:

Enter student name: Bob

Enter grades for 3 subjects (0 - 100):

Subject 1: 75

Subject 2: 80

Subject 3: 79

Student Averages:

Alice (ID: 5732): 87.67

Bob (ID: 4910): 78.00

Overall subject averages:

Subject 1: 80.00

Subject 2: 85.00

Subject 3: 83.50
