 Student Grade Manager
 
Author: Delina Merhay

Project Objective

My project proposal is to implement a Student Grade Manager, where each student is represented by a name, randomly generated ID, and grades. The system will store multiple students in an array and provide functions for user input of student details and grades (for multiple subjects or assignments). It will calculate and display individual average grades for each student and optionally calculate the overall average grade for all students in each subject. It will demonstrate key C++ concepts like arrays, functions, control structures, and input/output operations, etc.

Key Features

Input and storage of student details (name, ID, grades)
Random generation of 4-digit student IDs
Support for multiple subjects (currently set to 3, easily adjustable)
Calculation of individual student grade averages
Calculation of overall subject averages across all students
Input validation for grades (0-100 range)
Capacity to manage up to 100 students
