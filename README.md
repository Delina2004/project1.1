  Student Grade Manager
   Delina Merhay
       Project Objective
My project proposal is to implement a Student Grade Manager, where each student is represented by a name, randomly generated ID, and grades. The system will store multiple students in an array and provide functions for user input of student details and grades (for multiple subjects or assignments). It will calculate and display individual average grades for each student and optionally calculate the overall average grade for all students in each subject. It will demonstrate key C++ concepts like arrays, functions, control structures, input/output operations, etc.
